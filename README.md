# Operating_system_Assignment_Memory_management
**This java program to simulate memory allocation to allocate it
Variable-sized sections of memory into a specific sequence of
processing requests. Apply different allocation policies:**
### 1. First-Fit policy.
### 2. Best-Fit policy.
### 3. Worst-Fit policy.
● Add compaction (as option for the user): in compaction you shuffle
the memory contents so as to place all free memory together in one
large block.
Input will be as follows:
- Number of partition
- Partition name and its size.
- Number of process requests.
- Process name and its size.
- Selected policy by the user.

**Sample input:**

Enter number of partition:
6

Enter number of partition:
Partition0 90

Enter number of partition:
Partition1 20

Enter number of partition:
Partition2 5

Enter number of partition:
Partition3 30

Enter number of partition:
Partition4 120

Enter number of partition:
Partition5 80

Enter number of processes:
4

Process name and its size:
Process1 15

Process name and its size:
Process2 90

Process name and its size:
Process3 30

Process name and its size:
Process4 100

Select the policy you want to apply:
1. First fit
2. Worst fit
3. Best fit.
